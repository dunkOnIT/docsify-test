## Twizzle

<a href="https://alpha.twizzle.net/"><img src="assets/twizzle-social-media-image.png" width="256">

Twizzle</a> is based on `cubing.js`, and is currently being developed at [`src/sites/alpha.twizzle.net`](./src/sites/alpha.twizzle.net/).

## Documentation

If you want to display algs or solves, the following code is a good way to get started:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.cubing.net/esm/cubing/twisty"
  type="module"
  defer
></script>
<twisty-player alg="R U R' U R U2' R'"></twisty-player>
```

You can find more documentation at [`js.cubing.net/cubing/`](https://js.cubing.net/cubing).  
The source for the documentation site is currently inside the [`docs`](./docs/) folder of this repository.

## Development

Development relies on [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started). Once you have installed those, you can run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js && cd cubing.js
make dev
```

This should run `npm install` and then open [the `sites` root file](./src/sites/index.html) at http://localhost:3333/ automatically. Any source code changes will refresh the browser. We don't yet have a development guide, so you'll have to search the code to find where features are implemented.

The core library code for `cubing.js` is in [`src/cubing`](./src/cubing/) To test changes, use:

```shell
make test
```
