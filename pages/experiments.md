The experiments in the left navigation bar demonstrate various uses of the `cubing.js` library. 

The source code for all of these experiments can be found in [`cubing.js/src/sites/experiments.cubing.net`](https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js/tree/main/src/sites/experiments.cubing.net). You can use these experiments to guide you as you use the library while we are still building out detailed documentation.

If you would like to help with setting up documentation, you can consider [contributing](http://127.0.0.1:4000/contributing)!
